Expanding cards are interactive containers or panels that initially appear as compact or condensed elements on a webpage. When a user interacts with them, typically by clicking or hovering over the card, they expand or unfold to reveal additional content or information. This expansion is accompanied by animations and transitions, making the process smooth and visually appealing.
